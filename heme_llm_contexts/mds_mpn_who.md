### Summary Table: Diagnostic Criteria for Subtypes of Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MDS/MPN)

#### Table 1: Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
| **MDS/MPN Subtypes** | **Definition** |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) | Characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis and various combinations of somatic mutations. |
| MDS/MPN with neutrophilia | Renamed from "atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia." |
| MDS/MPN with SF3B1 mutation and thrombocytosis | Redefined based on SF3B1 mutation. |
| MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified | Updated terminology. |

#### Table 2: Diagnostic Criteria of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML)
| **Prerequisite Criteria** | **Supporting Criteria** | **Requirements for Diagnosis** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1. Persistent absolute (≥0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and relative (≥10%) peripheral blood monocytosis. | 1. Dysplasia involving ≥1 myeloid lineages. | - Pre-requisite criteria must be present in all cases. |
| 2. Blasts constitute <20% of the cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. | 2. Acquired clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormality. | - If monocytosis is ≥1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L: one or more supporting criteria must be met. |
| 3. Not meeting diagnostic criteria of chronic myeloid leukaemia or other myeloproliferative neoplasms. | 3. Abnormal partitioning of peripheral blood monocyte subsets. | - If monocytosis is ≥0.5 and <1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L: supporting criteria 1 and 2 must be met. |
| 4. Not meeting diagnostic criteria of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions. | | |
| **Subtyping Criteria** | | |
| - Myelodysplastic CMML (MD-CMML): WBC < 13 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L | | |
| - Myeloproliferative CMML (MP-CMML): WBC ≥ 13 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L | | |
| **Subgrouping Criteria (based on percentage of blasts and promonocytes)** | | |
| - CMML-1: <5% in peripheral blood and <10% in bone marrow | | |
| - CMML-2: 5–19% in peripheral blood and 10–19% in bone marrow | | |

### Medical Decision Tree (MDT) for Diagnosing and Subtyping MDS/MPN

#### Step 1: Initial Evaluation
1. **Assess Peripheral Blood and Bone Marrow**
   - **Monocytosis**: Check for persistent absolute (≥0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and relative (≥10%) peripheral blood monocytosis.
   - **Blast Count**: Determine blast percentage in peripheral blood and bone marrow (<20%).
   - **Dysplasia**: Look for dysplasia in ≥1 myeloid lineages.
   - **Molecular and Cytogenetic Abnormalities**: Identify any acquired clonal abnormalities.
   - **Monocyte Subset Partitioning**: Assess for abnormal partitioning of peripheral blood monocyte subsets.

#### Step 2: Exclude Other Diseases
2. **Exclude Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)**
   - Ensure the patient does not meet diagnostic criteria for CML.
3. **Exclude Other Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)**
   - Ensure the patient does not meet diagnostic criteria for other MPN, especially those with high MPN-associated mutations (e.g., JAK2, CALR, MPL).
4. **Exclude Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Tyrosine Kinase Fusions**
   - Ensure the patient does not have tyrosine kinase fusions associated with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms.

#### Step 3: Confirm CMML Diagnosis
3. **Confirm CMML**
   - If all prerequisite criteria are met, confirm the diagnosis of CMML.
   - If monocytosis is ≥1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, at least one supporting criterion must be met.
   - If monocytosis is ≥0.5 and <1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, both supporting criteria (dysplasia and clonal abnormality) must be met.

#### Step 4: Subtype CMML
4. **Subtype Based on WBC**
   - **MD-CMML**: WBC < 13 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
   - **MP-CMML**: WBC ≥ 13 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
5. **Subgroup Based on Blasts and Promonocytes**
   - **CMML-1**: <5% blasts in peripheral blood and <10% in bone marrow.
   - **CMML-2**: 5–19% blasts in peripheral blood and 10–19% in bone marrow.

#### Step 5: Identify Specific MDS/MPN Subtypes
5. **MDS/MPN with Neutrophilia**
   - Renamed from "atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia."
6. **MDS/MPN with SF3B1 Mutation and Thrombocytosis**
   - Diagnose based on SF3B1 mutation.
7. **MDS/MPN, Not Otherwise Specified**
   - Use updated terminology for cases that do not fit other specific subtypes.

#### Step 6: Consider Additional Features
6. **Myeloid Neoplasms with TP53 Mutation**
   - Check for TP53 mutations, which may affect prognosis and management.
7. **Myeloid Neoplasms Associated with Germline Predisposition**
   - Investigate for germline mutations predisposing to myeloid neoplasms (e.g., SF3B1, RUNX1, CEBPA).

### Final Notes
- **Blast Cutoff**: The blast cutoff for CMML is <20%, which is different from the 20% cutoff for AML.
- **Genetic Abnormalities**: Emphasize the importance of genetic testing for defining specific MDS/MPN subtypes.
- **Clinical Correlation**: Always correlate morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular findings for accurate diagnosis and subtyping.
