## Medical Decision Tree (MDT) for Diagnosing and Subtyping Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

### Step 1: Confirm AML Diagnosis

- **Criteria for AML Diagnosis**:
  - Blasts ≥20% in the bone marrow or peripheral blood
  - Presence of genetic abnormalities, cytogenetic abnormalities, or morphologic features consistent with AML
  - Exclude other causes of elevated blasts (e.g., reactive conditions, other hematologic disorders)

### Step 2: Assess Blast Percentage and Morphology

- **Blast Percentage**:
  - Blasts <10%: Consider MDS or other pre-leukemic conditions
  - Blasts 10-19%: Consider MDS/AML or MDS with increased blasts
  - Blasts ≥20%: Confirm AML diagnosis

### Step 3: Identify Specific Genetic and Cytogenetic Abnormalities

1. **AML with Specific Translocations or Rearrangements**
   - Check for presence of translocations or rearrangements (e.g., t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16), t(9;11), t(6;9), t(3;3), t(9;22)).
   - If positive, assign to the corresponding AML subtype.

2. **AML with Specific Gene Mutations**
   - Check for presence of mutations in NPM1, CEBPA, or TP53.
   - If positive, assign to the corresponding AML subtype.

3. **AML with Myelodysplasia-Related Features**
   - Check for presence of mutations in ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, U2AF1, or ZRSR2.
   - Check for complex karyotype, del(5q), -7/del(7q), +8, del(12p)/t(12p), i(17q), -17/add(17p), or del(20q).
   - If positive, assign to MDS/AML with myelodysplasia-related gene mutations or cytogenetic abnormalities.

4. **AML with Germline Predisposition**
   - Check for germline mutations in genes listed in Table 24 (e.g., CEBPA, DDX41, TP53, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6, GATA2, SAMD9, SAMD9L, IKZF1, PAX5).
   - If positive, specify the germline predisposition as a qualifier in the diagnosis.

### Step 4: Evaluate Prognostic Factors

- **TP53 Mutations**:
  - Presence of TP53 mutations indicates a highly aggressive subtype with poor prognosis.
  - Confirm whether the TP53 mutation is single or multi-hit (≥10% VAF or LOH at the 17p locus).

- **Complex Karyotype**:
  - Presence of complex karyotype (≥3 unrelated clonal abnormalities) indicates a poor prognosis.

- **Myelodysplasia-Related Features**:
  - Presence of myelodysplasia-related cytopenias or dysplasia in bone marrow.

### Step 5: Assign Subtype and Confirm Diagnosis

- Based on the findings from Steps 2-4, assign the specific AML subtype.
- Document the blast percentage, genetic abnormalities, cytogenetic abnormalities, and morphologic features in the final diagnosis.

### Step 6: Consider Therapy-Related AML

- Check for history of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immune interventions.
- If present, specify "therapy-related" as a qualifier in the diagnosis.

### Step 7: Consider Pediatric and Germline Predisposition

- For pediatric cases (<18 years), consider specific pediatric subtypes and germline predisposition.
- For germline predisposition, specify the underlying mutation or syndrome as a qualifier.

## Final Diagnosis Format

- **Example 1**: AML with t(15;17)/PML::RARA, blasts 30%, therapy-related
- **Example 2**: MDS/AML with myelodysplasia-related gene mutations (SF3B1, RUNX1), blasts 15%, germline predisposition (SAMD9)

This MDT incorporates all diagnostic criteria for each subtype of AML, ensuring a systematic and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and subtyping. It also accounts for myeloid neoplasms with TP53 mutations and those associated with germline predisposition, as required.
