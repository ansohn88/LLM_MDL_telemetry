## Medical Decision Tree (MDT) for Diagnosing and Subtyping Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)

### **Step 1: Confirm Persistent Cytopenia**

- **Criterion:** Sustained white blood count (WBC) ≥13 × 10^9/L, neutrophil count ≥0.5 × 10^9/L, or platelet count ≥450 × 10^9/L, or thrombocytosis allowed in MDS-del(5q) or any MDS case with inv(3) or t(3;3) cytogenetic abnormality.
- **Action:** If persistent cytopenia is confirmed, proceed to the next step.

### **Step 2: Assess Dysplasia**

- **Criterion:** Presence of dysplastic lineages (typically ≥1 for most subtypes, except MDS without dysplasia).
- **Action:** 
  - If dysplasia is present, proceed to **Step 3**.
  - If dysplasia is absent, classify as **MDS, NOS without dysplasia** and proceed to **Step 5**.

### **Step 3: Evaluate Cytogenetics and Mutations**

- **Action:** Perform cytogenetic analysis and genetic testing to identify specific mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities.
  - **If del(5q) is identified:** Classify as **MDS-del(5q)**.
  - **If SF3B1 mutation (≥10% VAF) is identified:** Classify as **MDS-SF3B1**.
  - **If multi-hit TP53 mutations are identified:** Classify as **MDS with mutated TP53**.
  - **If other cytogenetic abnormalities or mutations are present:** Proceed to **Step 4**.

### **Step 4: Assess Blasts**

- **Action:** Evaluate the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB).
  - **If BM blasts are <5% and PB blasts are <2%:** Classify as **MDS, NOS with single or multilineage dysplasia**.
  - **If BM blasts are 5-9% or PB blasts are 2-9%:** Classify as **MDS-EB**.
  - **If BM blasts are 10-19% or PB blasts are ≥20%:** Classify as **MDS/AML**.
  - **If TP53 mutations are present with ≥10% VAF and complex karyotype or 17p deletion:** Classify as **MDS with mutated TP53**.

### **Step 5: Evaluate for Myeloid Neoplasms with TP53 Mutation**

- **Action:** If TP53 mutations are identified:
  - **If blasts are 0-9%:** Classify as **MDS with mutated TP53**.
  - **If blasts are 10-19%:** Classify as **MDS/AML with mutated TP53**.
  - **If blasts are ≥20% or meet criteria for pure erythroid leukemia:** Classify as **AML with mutated TP53**.

### **Step 6: Evaluate for Pediatric Disorders and Germline Predisposition**

- **Action:** If the patient is pediatric (age < 18 years) or has a germline predisposition:
  - **If features of JMML are present (constitutive activation of RAS pathway):** Classify as **JMML**.
  - **If features of other germline predisposition disorders are present:** Classify according to the specific germline disorder.

### **Step 7: Final Classification**

- **Action:** Based on the above steps, assign the final subtype of MDS, MDS-EB, MDS/AML, or AML, incorporating any TP53 mutations or germline predispositions.

## Notes:

- **†:** Dysplasia is typically present but not required for MDS-EB and MDS/AML.
- **§:** For pediatric patients (<18 years), the blast thresholds for MDS-EB are 5% to 19% in BM and 2% to 19% in PB.
- **∥:** For pediatric patients, the entity MDS/AML does not apply.
- **††:** AML-defining cytogenetics are listed in the AML section.
- **\*:** Defined as 2 distinct TP53 mutations (each VAF > 10%) or a single TP53 mutation with a 17p deletion, VAF > 50%, or copy-neutral LOH at the 17p TP53 locus.

This MDT incorporates all diagnostic criteria for MDS subtypes, including myeloid neoplasms with TP53 mutations and those associated with germline predisposition, ensuring a comprehensive and structured approach to diagnosis and subtyping.
