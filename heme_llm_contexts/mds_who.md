| **MDS with increased blasts (MDS-IB)**       | - 5–19% BM blasts or 2–19% PB blasts. - Presence of cytopenias. - Increased blast percentage in bone marrow or peripheral blood. |
| **MDS with fibrosis (MDS-f)**               | - 5–19% BM blasts; 2–19% PB blasts. - Presence of fibrosis in the bone marrow. |
| **Childhood MDS with low blasts (cMDS-LB)** | - <5% BM blasts; <2% PB blasts. - Refractory cytopenias in children (<18 years of age). - Features similar to MDS-LB in adults. |
| **Childhood MDS with increased blasts (cMDS-IB)** | - ≥5% BM blasts or ≥2% PB blasts. - Presence of cytopenias. - Increased blast percentage in bone marrow or peripheral blood. - More common in children compared to MDS-LB. |
| **Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with SF3B1 mutation and thrombocytosis** | - SF3B1 mutation. - Thrombocytosis. - Presence of cytopenias and dysplasia in other cell lines. |
| **Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, not otherwise specified** | - Presence of cytopenias and dysplasia. - Lack of specific molecular or cytogenetic abnormalities. |
| **Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)**  | - Sustained peripheral blood monocytosis (≥0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). - Various combinations of somatic mutations involving epigenetic regulation, splicingosome, and signal transduction genes. - Documentation of dysplasia in at least one lineage. |
| **Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with TP53 mutation** | - TP53 mutations. - Cytopenias and dysplasia. - Complex cytogenetic abnormalities. |
| **Myeloid neoplasms associated with germline predisposition** | - Germline pathogenic variants in genes such as GATA2, DDX41, Fanconi anemia (FA), or telomerase complex genes. - Hypoplastic bone marrow and evolution to MDS and/or AML. |

## Medical Decision Tree (MDT) for Diagnosis and Subtyping of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)

### **Step 1: Initial Evaluation**

- **Patient Presentation:** Assess for symptoms of cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), fatigue, infections, bleeding, etc.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measure peripheral blood counts (WBC, RBC, platelets).
- **Bone Marrow Evaluation:** Perform bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to assess cellularity, blast percentage, and dysplasia.

### **Step 2: Cytopenias and Blast Percentage**

- **If <5% BM blasts and <2% PB blasts:**
  - Proceed to **Step 3**.
- **If 5–19% BM blasts or 2–19% PB blasts:**
  - Proceed to **Step 4**.
- **If ≥20% BM blasts or PB blasts:**
  - Consider acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and exclude MDS. Refer to AML diagnostic criteria.

### **Step 3: Low Blast Percentage (MDS-LB)**

- **Cytogenetic and Molecular Analysis:**
  - **If 5q deletion:**
    - Diagnose as **MDS-5q**.
  - **If SF3B1 mutation:**
    - Diagnose as **MDS-SF3B1**.
  - **If biallelic TP53 inactivation:**
    - Diagnose as **MDS-biTP53**.
  - **If no specific genetic abnormality:**
    - Diagnose as **MDS with low blasts (MDS-LB)**.
- **If hypocellular bone marrow:**
  - Diagnose as **Hypoplastic MDS (MDS-h)**.

### **Step 4: Increased Blast Percentage (MDS-IB)**

- **Presence of Fibrosis:**
  - **If fibrosis is present:**
    - Diagnose as **MDS with fibrosis (MDS-f)**.
  - **If fibrosis is absent:**
    - Diagnose as **MDS with increased blasts (MDS-IB)**.

### **Step 5: Childhood MDS**

- **Age <18 years:**
  - **If <5% BM blasts; <2% PB blasts:**
    - Diagnose as **Childhood MDS with low blasts (cMDS-LB)**.
  - **If ≥5% BM blasts or ≥2% PB blasts:**
    - Diagnose as **Childhood MDS with increased blasts (cMDS-IB)**.

### **Step 6: Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm**

- **If SF3B1 mutation and thrombocytosis:**
  - Diagnose as **Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with SF3B1 mutation and thrombocytosis**.
- **If TP53 mutation:**
  - Diagnose as **Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with TP53 mutation**.
- **If no specific molecular abnormality:**
  - Diagnose as **Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, not otherwise specified**.

### **Step 7: Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)**

- **If sustained peripheral blood monocytosis (≥0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L):**
  - **If documentation of dysplasia in at least one lineage:**
    - Diagnose as **Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)**.

### **Step 8: Myeloid Neoplasms Associated with Germline Predisposition**

- **If germline pathogenic variants in genes such as GATA2, DDX41, Fanconi anemia (FA), or telomerase complex genes:**
  - Diagnose as **Myeloid neoplasms associated with germline predisposition**.

## Final Notes

- **Molecular Testing:** Essential for distinguishing specific MDS subtypes, especially those with defining genetic abnormalities (e.g., SF3B1, TP53, 5q deletion).
- **Bone Marrow Morphology:** Critical for assessing dysplasia and blast percentage.
- **Clinical Correlation:** Integrate clinical, morphologic, and molecular findings to arrive at a definitive diagnosis and subtype.

This decision tree provides a structured approach to diagnosing and subtyping MDS, ensuring that all relevant diagnostic criteria and molecular features are considered.
