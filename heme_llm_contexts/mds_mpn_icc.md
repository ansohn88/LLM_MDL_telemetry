### Notes:
- **Myeloid Neoplasms with TP53 Mutation**: These cases should be evaluated separately, as TP53 mutations are associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.
- **Myeloid Neoplasms Associated with Germline Predisposition**: Patients with germline mutations (e.g., RUNX1, CEBPA) should be carefully evaluated for predisposition syndromes.

This decision tree incorporates all the diagnostic criteria for each subtype of MDS/MPN and provides a structured approach to diagnosis and subtyping.
