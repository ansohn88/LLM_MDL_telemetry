## Medical Decision Tree (MDT) for Diagnosis and Subtyping of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)

### Step 1: Initial Screening

- **Objective:** Identify the presence of myeloproliferative features.
  - **Criteria:**
    - Peripheral blood analysis: Elevated cell counts (erythrocytes, platelets, or leukocytes).
    - Bone marrow biopsy: Hypercellularity, abnormal morphology, and clonal markers.
    - Presence of clonal haematopoiesis (CH).

### Step 2: Identification of Specific MPN Subtypes

- **Objective:** Differentiate between specific MPN subtypes based on clinical, laboratory, and molecular features.

#### **Path 1: Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)**

1. **Check for**:
   - **BCR::ABL1** fusion (t(9;22)(q34;q11)).
2. **Stage Determination**:
   - **Chronic Phase (CP)**: Less than 20% myeloid blasts in blood or bone marrow.
   - **Blast Phase (BP)**: Presence of ≥20% myeloid blasts in blood or bone marrow.
   - **Accelerated Phase (AP)**: No longer a required phase in the current classification.

#### **Path 2: Polycythaemia Vera (PV)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Elevated haemoglobin concentration.
   - Trilineage hyperplasia (panmyelosis) on bone marrow biopsy.
   - Presence of mature megakaryocytes.
   - **JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation**.
2. **Exclude other causes**:
   - Secondary polycythaemia (e.g., hypoxia, smoking).

#### **Path 3: Essential Thrombocythaemia (ET)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Elevated platelet count.
   - Absence of other causes of thrombocytosis.
   - Presence of **JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations**.
2. **Exclude other causes**:
   - Secondary thrombocytosis (e.g., reactive, inflammatory).

#### **Path 4: Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Proliferation of abnormal megakaryocytes and granulocytes.
   - Fibrotic stroma in bone marrow.
   - **JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations**.
2. **Additional mutations**:
   - Presence of **EZH2, IDH1/2, SRSF2, U2AF1, ASXL1** mutations.
3. **Exclude other causes**:
   - Reactive fibrosis or other MPNs.

#### **Path 5: Chronic Neutrophilic Leukaemia (CNL)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Sustained peripheral blood neutrophilia (WBC ≥ 25 × 10⁹/L, ≥80% segmented neutrophils and bands).
   - Bone marrow hypercellularity due to neutrophilic granulocyte proliferation.
2. **Exclude other causes**:
   - Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) or other MPNs.

#### **Path 6: Chronic Eosinophilic Leukaemia (CEL)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Sustained clonal proliferation of morphologically abnormal eosinophils.
   - Presence of specific mutations (e.g., **CSF3R, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1**).
2. **Exclude other causes**:
   - Secondary eosinophilia (e.g., allergic, parasitic).

#### **Path 7: Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (JMML)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Haematopoietic stem cell-derived MPN of early childhood.
   - RAS pathway activation.
   - Germline pathogenic variants (e.g., **PTPN11, CBL**).
2. **Exclude other causes**:
   - Other MPNs or non-MPN conditions.

#### **Path 8: Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Not Otherwise Specified (MPN-NOS)**

1. **Check for**:
   - Clinical, laboratory, morphologic, and molecular features of MPN but lacking diagnostic criteria of any specific MPN type.

### Step 3: Further Refinement and Confirmation

- **Molecular Analysis**:
  - Perform comprehensive genetic testing to identify driver mutations and additional mutations.
  - Confirm the presence of clonal haematopoiesis (CH).
- **Clinical Follow-Up**:
  - Monitor for progression to advanced phases or transformation into other MPN subtypes.
  - Assess for comorbidities and complications.

### Step 4: Final Diagnosis and Subtyping

- Based on the findings from the above steps, assign the specific MPN subtype and stage.

## Notes:

- **Clonal Haematopoiesis (CH)** is recognized as a precursor state and is associated with increased mortality, cardiovascular diseases, and myeloid malignancies.
- **CHIP (Clonal Haematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential)** and **CCUS (Clonal Cytopenia of Undetermined Significance)** are formally defined in the classification.
- The classification emphasizes the integration of morphologic, immunophenotypic, molecular, and cytogenetic data for accurate diagnosis.
- The presence of specific mutations (e.g., **BCR::ABL1, JAK2, CALR, MPL**) is crucial for distinguishing between MPN subtypes.

This MDT ensures a systematic and comprehensive approach to diagnosing and subtyping myeloproliferative neoplasms, incorporating all relevant diagnostic criteria and molecular insights.
